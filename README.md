Hello, I'm Aasim Raza ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer and Project Lead with a strong focus on Frontend development and a detailed eye for creating seamless, user-friendly interfaces. My expertise spans Angular (v6 to v18), SvelteKit, React, Node.js, PHP, SQL, WordPress, Shopify Customization, WebFlow, and SquareUp.

 ðŸ‘‰ **My Approach to Development**
I believe in writing clean, reusable, and efficient code. My goal is always to write code once and reuse it across the project to maintain consistency and make future updates easy and efficient. I prioritize modular, maintainable code structures that reduce complexity, are easy to understand, and can be scaled as the project grows. For me, simplicity and clarity are as crucial as functionality.
